# Health Center Dashboards

For this project I created two dashboards. The first providing an overview of the HRSA Health Center Program at the national level including several graphs relating to the national patient population as well as a map of all health center sites across the country. The second dashboard provides a similar overview, but at the individual health center level, allowing the viewer to select one health center and view data relating to that specific organization.
